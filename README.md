# Amyloid positivity classification

## Overview

This repository is designed to provide tools and models for the classification of amyloid positivity. Amyloid positivity is a critical marker for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to process imaging and clinical data, ensuring robust predictions and aiding in the early detection and management of these conditions.
